This is my personal project.
I take a lot of different Vitamins and supplements
and wanted some place to keep track of them all.

I created a datbase on localhost, that I then add
all my vitamins into. I'm currently working on
setting up a search form, so that I can see what
I should take with what and what time of day.

I have lots of little bits to add to it, and it's a work
in progress. Don't know if i will ver finish it.
I'm proud I got as far as I have in less than a week.

Maybe you can use this code to create your own database
for whtever you need a database for.
